# Identification of Handwritten digit images using different classification algorithms such as Multi-class Logistic Regression, Single Hidden Layer Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network.

## Project Summary
***
We have trained our classification model on MNIST data using Multi-classLogistic Regression, Single Hidden Layer Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network and predicted the labels of the digit images in both MNIST and USPS digit dataset.
### Logistic Regression:
  * We trained the model and tuned the hyperparameter i.e. learning rate, by using our own implementation of Logistic regression, we achieved an accuracy of 91.56% on MNIST test images and 45.15% on USPS test images at learning rate of 0.14 and lambda (regulariser) value of 0. 
  * Using tensorflow, we have achieved an accuracy of 92.41% on MNIST test images and 48.32% on USPS test images
### Single hidden layer neural network:
  * We trained the model and tuned the hyperparameter i.e. learning rate and number of units in hidden layer, we achieved an accuracy of 97.76% on MNIST test images and 64.6% on USPS test images.
### Convolutional Neural Network:
  * On training the model using CNN, we achieved an accuracy of 99.18% on MNIST test images and 75% on USPS test images.
### No Free Lunch theorem remains valid:
  * Accuracies of the models on the USPS data were way lower than the accuracies they gave for the MNIST dataset. After seeing such performance of all the three training models on the USPS data set which were trained on the MNIST data set we can conclude that our model is not the best in the general way but performs well on the dataset in which it was trained. Our model needs to have the training knowledge of the USPS data in order to perform well on the USPS data set.

## Approach
***
### Logistic Regression
* MNIST dataset files were downloaded from the website mentioned in the main.pdf have been read using the gzip library function of the python with the help of direction mentioned in this [website](https://martin-thoma.com/classify-mnist-with-pybrain/).
* Train and Test Images were then flattened into 2D numpy array, N x 784 size.
* Train image data and Test image data have been then standardised with zero mean and unit standard deviation.
* Previous two steps were performed similarly on the USPS test data.
* Weight numpy array was generated valus of 1s and dimension of K x D, where K is the number of classes i.e., 10 and D is the number of data features plus 1 bias feature i.e., (784 + 1).
* Column of 1s was added as the first column to both Train set and the Test sets of MNIST and USPS data making the total feature dimension of 785
* One hot vectors of MNIST data labels and USPS data labels were created.
* Separate functions for calculating the **Cross Entropy error**, **Gradient descent**, **Softmax**, and **Predicting** the image labels were created in the LRlibs.py file.
  * **Cross Entropy error** function was implemented as per the formula.
  * **Gradient descent** function was done using the pseudo code mentioned in the document provided along with the Project 3
  * **Softmax** function was implemented using the exp(x − max(x))/Σexp(x) formula.
  * **Predict** function was implemented by returning the column which had max of the W.dot(X) in each row.
* Model was trained on the Training data images with epoch count of 200
and varying learning rate of 0.01 to 0.14. ​The accuracies and the cross
entropy error have been tabulated in the tables 1.1 and 1.2 for both MNIST
and USPS data sets.
### Single Hidden Layer Neural Network
* This has been implemented using TensorFlow
* The model consists of one hidden layer and one output layer
* In hidden layer, we have initialized 784x1024 weights and 1024 bias for 1024 units by random values. Then, multiplied the input with the weights and added bias to it. On this value, applied ReLU activation function.
* The output of hidden layer is fed to the output layer. The output layer consists of 1024x10 weights and 10 bias for 10 units in this layer and are randomly initialized.
* The output of the model is obtained by multiplying these weights with output from hidden layer and adding bias of output layer. Output will be a one-hot representation of the predicted label
* We have trained the above model using AdamOptimizer with number of epochs = 20000 and input batch size = 50 in each epoch and chose that model which has the minimum cross-entropy error 
* We have tuned the hyperparameters such as number of units in hidden layer (784, 864, 944, 1024) and learning rate (0.01 to 0.05) and chose the model which has maximum accuracy on validation set
* Then, ran the model on MNIST and USPS test data to get test accuracy.
### Convolutional Neural Network
* This is also implemented using TensorFlow 
* The model consists of 4 layers: Convolution layer 1 (convolution with 32 features applied on 5x5 patch of image + 2D max pooling), convolution layer 2 (convolution with 64 features applied on 5x5 patch of image + 2D max pooling), fully connected layer with 1024 neurons and ReLU activation function, logit layer with 10 neurons corresponding to 10 labels.
* In fully connected layer, few neuron outputs are dropped out to prevent overfitting. The no_drop_prob placeholder makes sure that dropout occurs only during training and not during testing.
* Trained the model using AdamOptimizer with learning rate set to 1e-4 and number of epochs= 20000 on input batches of size 50 and chose that model which has the minimum cross-entropy error.
* Then, ran the model on MNIST and USPS test data to get test accuracy. USPS test set was divided.
* No need of tuning of hyperparameter in CNN.
### USPS data extraction:
* While extracting USPS image features, we have to make it resemble to the MNIST image features as close as possible so that our trained model can classify the images correctly.
* In order to do that, we followed below steps:
  * Resized the image to square shape i.e. width = height = max(width, height) it was done in such a way that the aspect ratio of the digits was not skewed.
  * Converted the image into grayscale.
  * Inverted the image pixels value, that is 255 - Image, black became white and vice-versa so has to follow same pixels values that of the MNIST images.
  * Resized the each image to 28x28
  * Normalized the image pixels with ([value-min]/[max-min]) formula
  * Flattened each image into 1x784 numpy array
